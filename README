NAME
    Continuity::Monitor - monitor and inspect a Continuity server

SYNOPSIS
      #!/usr/bin/perl

      use strict;
      use Continuity;
      use Continuity::Monitor;

      my $server = new Continuity( port => 8080 );
      my $monitor = Continuity::Monitor->new( server => $server, port => 8081 );
      $server->loop;

DESCRIPTION
    NOTE: Currently this is broken, only Continuity::Monitor::CGI works. But
    I wanted to get it out on CPAN anyway.

    This is an application to monitor and inspect your running application.
    It has its own web interface on a separate port. It is very rough!

    The monitor does several things. First, this is a monitoring tool for
    working with the sessions your server is running. You can view and kill
    each session. Secondly it is an inspector for each session -- letting
    you see the current state including variables. And third, it will let
    you actually change the values of these sessions, or even run code in
    their context.

    (well... it _will_ do all those things :) )

METHODS
  $monitor = Continuity::Monitor->new( server => $server, ... )
    This is just like Continuity->new, and takes all of the same parameters,
    except that instead of running your code it is a self-contained
    application.
