== AJAX Plugins ==

Plugins could also be allowed to use AJAX to communicate back to the server. A
flag could be set to skip the wrapping output. More specifically, the flag
could be set to just get the output of a single module.

== Keep-Alive ==

We could send a byte ever now and then to the browser so that it doesn't time
out. A space will probably work (HTML mostly ignores it), but maybe we could
send some other character like \0 or something.

== JS / CSS Plugin ==

Make the javascript and CSS of the current setup a plugin, so that someone else
can do better than I did or so that you could have an AJAX version
